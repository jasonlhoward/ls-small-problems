# Letter Counter (Part 1)

# Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words
# and returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.

# Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.

# Examples

# word_sizes('Four score and seven.') == { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 6 => 1 }
# word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') == { 3 => 5, 6 => 1, 7 => 2 }
# word_sizes("What's up doc?") == { 6 => 1, 2 => 1, 4 => 1 }
# word_sizes('') == {}

def word_sizes(words)
  # hash = {} # <- hash does not have a default value
  # the default value for all keys is 0
  hash = Hash.new(0)
  words.split(' ').each do |word|
    # if hash.key?(word.length)
    #   hash[word.length] += 1
    # else
    #   hash[word.length] = 1
    # end
    hash[word.length] += 1
  end
  hash
end
