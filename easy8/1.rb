# Sum of Sums

# Write a method that takes an Array of numbers and then returns the sum of the
# sums of each leading subsequence for that Array.
# You may assume that the Array always contains at least one number.

# Examples:

# sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
# sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
# sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
# sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

def sum_of_sums(arr)
  total_sum = 0
  arr.size.times do |x|
    sum = 0
    (x+1).times do |y|
      sum += arr[y]
    end
    total_sum += sum
  end
  total_sum
end

p sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
p sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
p sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
p sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

# Solution

# def sum_of_sums(numbers)
#   sum_total = 0
#   1.upto(numbers.size) do |count|
#     sum_total += numbers.slice(0, count).reduce(:+)
#   end
#   sum_total
# end
# Discussion

# This solution is a bit dense, so let's break it up piece by piece.

# For this exercise, we want to compute the sum of sums. One way to do that is
#   to have a variable for the total sum.

# Then, we can sum up subsets of our array and add each of those sums onto
# this sum_total variable.

# Once we have computed the final sum(one that contains all numbers in our array),
# and added that to our total sum, then we are finished.

# 1.upto(numbers.size) is used to generate the correct size for each subset of
# our numbers array. We use number.slice(0, count) to get that subset, and then
# reduce(:+) is used on the current subset to add up all its elements.
