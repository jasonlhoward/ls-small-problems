# Madlibs

# Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for
# words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them
# into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb,
# and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

# Example

# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly

# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

  print "Enter an adjective: "
  adjective = gets.chomp
  print "Enter an adverb: "
  adverb = gets.chomp
  puts "\nDo you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's hilarious!"
