# Combine Two Lists

# Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments, and
# returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments,
# with the elements taken in alternation.

# You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty,
# and that they have the same number of elements.

# Example:

# interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

# def interleave(a1, a2)
#   result_array = []
#   a1.length.times do |x|
#     result_array << a1[x] << a2[x]
#   end
#   result_array
# end

def interleave(a1, a2)
  a1.zip(a2).flatten
end

# p interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']
p interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'])

# Solution

# def interleave(array1, array2)
#   result = []
#   array1.each_with_index do |element, index|
#     result << element << array2[index]
#   end
#   result
# end
# Discussion

# In our solution, we use #each_with_index to get values and index numbers for
# array1, then use the index number to access the corresponding element in array2.

# Further Exploration

# Take a few minutes to read about Array#zip. #zip doesn't do the same thing
#   as interleave, but it is very close, and more flexible. In fact,
#   interleave can be implemented in terms of zip and one other method from
#   the Array class. See if you can rewrite interleave to use zip.
