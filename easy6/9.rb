# Does My List Include This?

# Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as
# arguments. This method should return true if the search value is in the
# array, false if it is not.
# You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

# include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
# include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
# include?([], 3) == false
# include?([nil], nil) == true
# include?([], nil) == false

def include?(arr, val)
  arr.each { |el| return el == val if el == val }
  false
end

p include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
p include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
p include?([], 3) == false
p include?([nil], nil) == true
p include?([], nil) == false

# Solution

# The easy way

# def include?(array, value)
#   !!array.find_index(value)
# end
# A slightly harder way

# def include?(array, value)
#   array.each { |element| return true if value == element }
#   false
# end
# Discussion

# The first method uses Array#find_index to scan the array for the first
# element that has the specified value. find_index returns the index number
# of the found element, which will always have a truthy value, or nil if no
# such element is present. We then use !! to force the return value to
# true or false in accordance with the implied promise of the ? in include?.

# The second method does essentially the same thing, but it uses each instead
# of find_index. This takes a little bit more work, since we are explicitly
# returning false if the value is not found.

# Further Exploration

# Can you think of other solutions to this problem? There are lots of
# different ways to get the same result.
